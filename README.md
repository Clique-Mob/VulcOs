VulcOs
======

A bootable multitool environment for Windows. This is the next step of Project Charon (https://github.com/Clique-Mob/Project_Charon).
This is not going to ever completely replace Charon. Instead this will offer an environment for Charon to be able to apply some more drastic changes,
as well as offer a place for a variety of other tools to function.

At this stage, VulcOs will be based on a Linux distro, modified to a LiveCD format thanks to Reconstructor (http://www.reconstructor.org/). All credit
for the modifications and packaging of the distro that allows for VulcOs to be a packed LiveCD goes to Reconstructor's developers.

Any and all other tools used or included in VulcOs not created by Clique-Mob will be credited to their developers. If you see anything we miss, please
feel free to create an issue report.

VulcOs, as well as the tools used within it, will be open source.
